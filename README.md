# Handwritten Recognition Using Artificial Neural Networks

This project involves the development of a handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The system is trained on the **MNIST dataset** to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and can predict these digits from both static images and live drawings. The project is implemented in Python using machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a widely studied problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. This project aims to develop a high-accuracy model that can recognize handwritten digits from images or live inputs. The model is built using a CNN based on the **LeNet-5 architecture**, with additional layers to improve performance.

Key features of the project:
- **Digit recognition** from static images and live drawings.
- **High accuracy** achieved through deep learning using CNN.
- Real-time predictions using a pre-trained model.
